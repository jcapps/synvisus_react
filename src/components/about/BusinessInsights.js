                    With extensive experience in a variety of industries, our consultants 
                    bring a practical sensibility and industry-specific expertise to the 
                    strategic challenges facing our clients. We understand that slick 
                    software builds mean nothing unless applied in the context of a functional 
                    organizational structure and a sound strategic vision.
